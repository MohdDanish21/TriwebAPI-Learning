// OOPS moves around its four most important pillars. 
// These are; 
// Inheritance
// Polymorphism
// Abstraction
// Encapsulation
                                             // 1 (inheritance)---> 

// Inheritance is a procedure to inherit the features from parent to child in the real world.
//  Similarly, Inheritance in OOPS is a procedure by which one ClassClass acquires all the properties
//  and behaviors of the parent class. 
//  Inheritance ensures the reusability of the code.


                                    // Types of Inheritance
//                          There are a total of five types of Inheritance in OOPS.

                                        // Single Inheritance
                                        // Multilevel Inheritance
                                        // Hierarchical Inheritance
                                        // Multiple Inheritance
                                        // Hybrid Inheritance



//                                         Advantages of Inheritance
                                            // Code reusability
                                            // We can achieve Polymorphism using Inheritance. 





//                                             Disadvantages of Inheritance


// The child class and the parent class are tightly coupled. 
// Any changes in the parent class equally affect all the child classes.



                    // 2 (Polymorphism)


// Poly means many, and morphism means forms. 
// We know that Water also exists in multiple states, such as Solid, Liquid, and Gas. 
// So Water shows Polymorphism


                        // 3 (abstraction)

// Abstraction is a property of hiding the internal implementation and highlighting the setup services beneficial to the user. 
// For example, 
// the smartphone user does not know the internal performance of the Smartphone and its workings; 
// instead, they are interested in the services provided by the Smartphone. 

//  we can achieve abstraction in two ways.

// Using abstract ClassClass
// using interfaces 




// Advantages of abstraction 


// Reduces complexity
// Avoid code duplication 
// Ease the burden of maintenance
// Increase security and confidentiality 




                                // 3 (Encapsulation)

// Encapsulation is a mechanism to bundle the data and code acting on the data together as a single unit.
//  there are two steps to achieve encapsulation in Java

// declare the variable of a class as private
// Provide a Public setter and getter method to modify and view the values of the variables.



// Advantages of encapsulation 
// Loosely coupled code 
// Better access control and security
