//List of OOPs Concepts in Java


// 1.Class
// Class is one of the OOPs in Java, which refers to a collection of objects. 
// A class is a logical entity. It is one of the OOPs concepts in Java,
//  with examples like the creation of a blueprint from which an individual object can be developed. 

//2 Object
// In object oriented programming, anything that has a state and behavior falls under the category of an object. 
// It is one of the OOPs concepts in Java that can either be physical or logical.

// 3.Inheritance
// Inheritance refers to objects acquiring the behaviors and properties of a parent object. 
// It is an OOPs concept in Java with reusable code. 
// These Java OOPs concepts are useful for achieving runtime polymorphism. 
// It is often easy to understand the OOPs concepts in Java with examples. 

// 3.Polymorphism
// Polymorphism is an OOPs concept in Java that revolves around performing one task in multiple ways. For instance, 
// you might try to convince a customer in different ways. 
// In Java object oriented programming, overloading and overriding methods are used to achieve polymorphism. 


// 4.Abstraction
// In object oriented programming, abstraction involves showing functionality while hiding internal details. 
// Java OOPs concepts use abstract classes and interfaces to achieve abstraction.

// 5.Encapsulation
// Encapsulation is an OOPs concept in Java that involves binding code and data together in a single unit. 
// If you want to understand these OOPs concepts in Java with examples, you should consider a Java class. 
// Java Bean can be described as a fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private.


// Multithreading in Java

// Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program 
// for maximum utilization of CPU. 
// Each part of such program is called a thread. 
// So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.
