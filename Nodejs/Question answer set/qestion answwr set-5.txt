1. what shallow copy?
Shallow copying creates a new object with references to the same memory locations as the original object.

A shallow copy refers to a fact that only one level is copied.
it will work fine for an array or object containing primitive values.

(a).By spread operator(...)
this is a convenient way to make a shallow copy of an array or an object
when there is no nesting it works great.

(B).By Object.assign()
The same type of shallow copy would be created using object.assign().
it can be used with the object or array.

(C). .slice()

for any specifically, using the built-in slice method works the same as the spread operator.
it creates shallow copy of one level

(D). Array.from()
 It will make a shallow copy of a javascript Array.





2. what is deep copy?
while deep copying creates a new object with new memory locations for all of its properties 
and nested objects or arrays.

.A Deep copy construct a new compound object and then, recursively,inserts copies into t of the objects
found in the original.
.A deep copy can be made using lodash, R.clone () or you can write your own program.

(a).Lodash
The library Lodash is most common way javascript developer a deep copy

while using lodash install lodash(deep-copy vs shallow-copy\deep-copy> npm install lodash).
