 1 What is Arrow Function?

.Arrow function {()=>} is concise way of writing JavaScript functions in shorter way. 
.Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version. 
.They make our code more structured and readable. 
.Arrow functions are anonymous functions i.e. functions without a name but they are often assigned to any variable.

2 what is This in Arrow function?

. With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

3. what is call ()?

. call() provides a new value of this to the function/methods.
inheritance==> with call you can inherit a method.

The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. 
It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). 
With call() , an object can use a method belonging to another object.

4. what are Synchronous vs ASynchronous?
Synchronous JavaScript is the programming approach where tasks of a program are executed sequentially one at a time.

Asynchronous JavaScript is the programming method where operations are run independently allowing 
the program to continue running while waiting for certain tasks to complete.

5. Describe SetImmediate?
setImmediate() is a function in Node. 
js that schedules a callback to be executed immediately after the current Poll phase of the Event Loop completes. 

6. Describe SetTimeout?
A setTimeout() callback with a 0ms delay is very similar to setImmediate(). 
The execution order will depend on various factors, 
but they will be both run in the next iteration of the event loop.

7. Describe Process.nextTick?
process. nextTick is used to ensure an asynchronous operation is completed before other asynchronous operations begin. 
For example, 
it can guarantee that an event is emitted or a callback is executed after an operation is completed, 
but before other events or callbacks are processed

8. Describe apply()? and what is the difference apply and call?
difference 

In call() we pass arguments
In apply() we pass array


The apply() method is used to write methods, which can be used on different objects. 
It is different from the function call() because it takes arguments as an array.
 Syntax: apply() Return Value: It returns the method values of a given function
